# Emotion-Recognition-using-Deep-Learning-via-Facial-Expression
This project implements an Emotion Recognition System using an ensemble of nine convolutional neural networks (CNNs). It classifies facial emotions from the FER-2013 dataset and provides an interactive Streamlit web interface for image upload or webcam capture.
